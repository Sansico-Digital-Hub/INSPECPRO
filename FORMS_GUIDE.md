# InspecPro Forms Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Forms Not Showing in Web
**Problem:** Forms page requires ADMIN role to access.

**Solution:** Login with admin credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### 2. Conditional Logic Added
**Feature:** Unlimited conditional logic now available in form builder!

## ‚ú® New Feature: Conditional Logic

### What is Conditional Logic?
Conditional logic allows you to show/hide fields based on the values of other fields. This creates dynamic forms that adapt to user input.

### How to Use

1. **Create or Edit a Form**
   - Go to Forms ‚Üí New Form (or edit existing)
   - Add your fields

2. **Add Conditional Logic to a Field**
   - Scroll to the "Conditional Logic" section at the bottom of each field
   - Click "+ Add Condition"

3. **Configure Conditions**
   - **Select Field:** Choose which previous field to check
   - **Operator:** Choose comparison type:
     - `Equals` - Field value equals specific value
     - `Not Equals` - Field value does not equal value
     - `Contains` - Field value contains text
     - `Greater Than` - Numeric comparison
     - `Less Than` - Numeric comparison
     - `Is Empty` - Field has no value
     - `Is Not Empty` - Field has a value
   - **Value:** Enter the value to compare against

4. **Add Multiple Conditions**
   - Click "+ Add Condition" again for additional rules
   - **ALL conditions must be met** for the field to show (AND logic)

### Examples

#### Example 1: Show "Reason" field only if Status is "Hold"
```
Field 1: Status (Dropdown: Pass, Hold)
Field 2: Reason (Text)
  Conditional Logic:
    - Field: Status
    - Operator: Equals
    - Value: Hold
```

#### Example 2: Show "Temperature Details" only if Temperature > 100
```
Field 1: Temperature (Measurement)
Field 2: Temperature Details (Text)
  Conditional Logic:
    - Field: Temperature
    - Operator: Greater Than
    - Value: 100
```

#### Example 3: Multiple Conditions
```
Field 1: Equipment Type (Dropdown: Machine A, Machine B)
Field 2: Status (Dropdown: Pass, Hold)
Field 3: Machine A Hold Details (Text)
  Conditional Logic:
    - Field: Equipment Type
      Operator: Equals
      Value: Machine A
    - Field: Status
      Operator: Equals
      Value: Hold
```
This field only shows when BOTH conditions are true.

### Unlimited Conditions
- You can add as many conditions as needed
- Each field can have multiple conditional rules
- Conditions are evaluated in real-time during inspection

## üîÑ Form Management

### View Forms
- Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/forms
- See all active forms with field counts
- View creation dates

### Create New Form
1. Click "New Form" button
2. Enter form name and description
3. Add fields using "+ Add Field"
4. Configure each field
5. Add conditional logic if needed
6. Click "Create Form"

### Edit Form
1. Click pencil icon on form
2. Modify fields and settings

## üöÄ Using Forms in Inspections

### Inspector Workflow
1. Login as inspector
2. Go to "New Inspection"
3. Select a form
4. Fill out fields
5. Conditional fields appear/hide automatically
6. Submit inspection

### Conditional Logic in Action
- Fields with conditions are hidden by default
- As you fill the form, fields appear dynamically
- Only relevant fields are shown
- Reduces clutter and confusion

## üí° Best Practices

### Designing Forms with Conditional Logic

1. **Keep it Simple**
   - Start with basic fields
   - Add conditions gradually
   - Test as you build

2. **Logical Flow**
   - Place conditional fields after their trigger fields
   - Group related fields together
   - Use clear field names

3. **User Experience**
   - Don't hide critical information
   - Provide clear instructions
   - Test the form flow

4. **Common Patterns**
   - Status-based details (Pass ‚Üí no details, Hold ‚Üí require reason)
   - Equipment-specific checks
   - Measurement-based follow-ups
   - Role-based fields

### Form Organization
- Use descriptive form names
- Add clear descriptions
- Order fields logically
- Group related fields
- Use Notes fields for instructions

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Forms Not Showing
**Issue:** Can't see forms on forms page

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Login as admin (not inspector/supervisor/manager)
2. ‚úÖ Check backend is running: http://localhost:8000
3. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. ‚úÖ Verify forms exist in database

### Conditional Logic Not Working
**Issue:** Fields not showing/hiding correctly

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check field order (condition field must come before conditional field)
2. ‚úÖ Verify operator and value match exactly
3. ‚úÖ Test with simple condition first
4. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors

### Can't Create Forms
**Issue:** "Access Denied" or permission error

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Must be logged in as ADMIN
2. ‚úÖ Check token is valid (not expired)
3. ‚úÖ Verify backend permissions

## üìä Database Structure

### Forms Table
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `form_name` - Name of the form
- `description` - Form description
- `created_by` - User ID who created it
- `is_active` - Active/inactive status

### Form Fields Table
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `form_id` - Parent form
- `field_name` - Field label
- `field_type` - Type of field
- `field_options` - JSON with options and conditional_logic
- `field_order` - Display order
- `is_required` - Required flag

### Conditional Logic Structure (in field_options JSON)
```json
{
  "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2"],
  "conditional_logic": [
    {
      "field_index": 0,
      "operator": "equals",
      "value": "Hold"
    },
    {
      "field_index": 1,
      "operator": "greater_than",
      "value": "100"
    }
  ]
}
```
