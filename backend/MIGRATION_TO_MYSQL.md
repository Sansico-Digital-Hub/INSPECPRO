## MySQL Connection Details
```
Host: localhost
Port: 3306
Database: inspecpro
User: root
Password: Databaseya789
```

## Verification
Run the test script to verify connection:
```bash
python test_mysql_connection.py
```

## Old SQLite File
The old SQLite database file `inspecpro.db` is no longer used.
You can safely backup or delete it:
```bash
# Backup (optional)
move inspecpro.db inspecpro.db.backup

# Or delete
del inspecpro.db
```

## Application Status
✓ **READY TO USE** - All backend APIs now use MySQL database

## Next Steps
1. Start the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Test API endpoints
3. Verify frontend integration
4. Remove old SQLite file after confirming everything works

## Notes
- All foreign keys and constraints are properly set
- Indexes added for performance
- Connection pooling configured for production use
- Auto-increment IDs working correctly
- JSON fields supported for dynamic form options
